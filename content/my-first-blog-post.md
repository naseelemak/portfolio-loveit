Hello reader and welcome to my website.

I spent a big chunk of today exploring the world of web development and one of my conclusions is that relearning something can feel like you’re learning something for the first time.

Granted, a lot of the things I learned today about web development I had only known about by name.

If you guys don’t know yet, you can host your own static website on platforms like Netlify and GitHub Pages for free.

It really is easier and cheaper to host your own website these days. The only money I spent on this website was on my domain name jaedontan.com which I got on Namecheap.com at approximately 25 MYR for one year.
